How Covid-19 impacted the US Economy, and the prospect

# Importance of Topic:
Since the Covid-19 has appeared in early 2020 all over the world, governments around the world 
commanded individuals, businesses, and nationwide to shut down and limited the people’s 
movement. In such a process, individuals and business lose their work which worsened the global 
economy. In this research paper, we will be observing how the US economy has worsened during 
the covid-19 and the future of the prospect economy.

# Research Question
1. Within the past two years (2020 to 2022), how the US economy has been depressed?
(Focusing on GDP rate of change and Individual business)
2. How the US economy would be transformed in the future? Whether it would get better or 
getting worsened?

This paper will be used to predict the prospect of the economy after Covid-19 and analyzes 
why the global economy deteriorated from 2020 to 2022, which means it will be used to 
answer two research questions. First, from 2020 to 2022 global economy worsened because
the demand for the product was less. Therefore, to solve this economy problem, the only 
way to solve is to increase the demand of people. Otherwise, it will be difficult for 
individuals, businesses, and governments to get out of economic hardship.

This paper is about how the United States economy has changed and the perspective of the 
US economy. This paper predicts that it would take a long to recover the economy like 
before, but unfortunately, the economic situation would be worsened until the increase in 
demand. For instance, the unemployment rate increased, industrial would be interrupted for
a while, and economic growth would be very slow. Consequently, this article helps to 
answer the last research question, the prospective of the global economy.

This paper is the connection with published paper 1, ‘The global economic impact of 
COVID-19: A summary of the research.' The first published paper insists that the role and 
action of individuals' increase of demand are critical. But, based on the reference of the 
published paper 2, as individuals lost their job an increase in the unemployment rate would 
result that the hardship of the individual action. Therefore, this article introduces what the 
US government will do to recover the economy. The US government will invest its 
government budget to increase the job in the public sector and financially secure people, 
who lost their job.

# Data Cleaning and Exploration:
To visualize the data to compare the US economy before versus after Covid-19, using the 
report and Kaggle data with excel or CSV file would help to clean the data. Based on the 
year and GDP, I would like to divide them and make data visualization figure such as bar 
graph and map to compare before and after the Covid-19 economic situation. 
Unfortunately, predicting future economic prospects seems to require the use of simple data
visualization techniques such as line or bar graphs. The reason is that it is difficult to make 
concrete predictions about the economy, unlike existing data. However, other data may 
clarify what is causing the economic downturn through the data cleansing process.
